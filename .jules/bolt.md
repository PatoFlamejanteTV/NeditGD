## 2024-05-23 - Dictionary Lookup Performance
**Learning:** Python dictionary iteration (`.items()`) for reverse lookup is significantly slower than O(1) direct lookup, especially in hot paths like property name resolution.
**Action:** Always maintain a reverse mapping dictionary (e.g., `ID_TO_NAME`) when frequent bidirectional lookups are required. Pre-calculate constant sets/dictionaries at module level instead of recreating them in function calls.
